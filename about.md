I am a Data, python, and open source enthusiast. I currently work as research technichian at UNC-Wilmington. Some of the things I am working on are:

### [BuoyPy](https://github.com/NickC1/buoypy)

BuoyPy pulls data from the National Data Buoy Center, cleans it, and puts it into pandas dataframes.

### [NonLinPy](https://github.com/NickC1/nonlinpy)

NonLinPy is a package for performing nonlinear analysis. Reconstruct state spaces, forecast, and see if the behavior of a system as changed.
