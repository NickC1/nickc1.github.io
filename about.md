I am a data, python, and open source enthusiast. I currently work as a research technician at UNC Wilmington. Some of the packages I am working on are:

### [BuoyPy][buoypy-gh]

BuoyPy pulls data from the [National Data Buoy Center][ndbc], cleans it, and puts it into pandas dataframes.

### [skNLF][sknlf-gh]

skNLF is a package for performing nonlinear analysis in scikit learn's style. It can reconstruct state spaces, forecast, and see if the behavior of a system has changed.

### [skCCM][skccm-gh]

skCCM implements [convergent cross mapping][ccm-wiki] in scikit learn's style. It reconstructs the state spaces and determines if one time series is influencing another time series. It implements the procedure described in [Detecting Causality in Complex Ecosystems][ccm-paper].
