# Switching from Matlab to Python
by Nick Cortale

This guide will hopefully ease the transition from Matlab to python. Most of this post was taken from [Jake Vanderplas's][jvdp] "Introduction to Python" notebook. This notebook unfortunately, no longer exists or I can't find it.

**Downloads**

The first thing you will need to do is download the anaconda package manager. This installs everything you will need in the scientific stack --or mostly everything. This can be thought of as installing all the matlab toolboxes (except you will not need to pay thousands of dollars). This download will also include the jupyter notebook, which is where I do a lot of my data analysis and messing around with ideas. The download can be found here:

The next thing you will want to download is a text editor. This is where you will write your functions, classes, and anything else you could want. I like sublime text, but there are others out there that you can experiment with.

**Education**

There are a ton of resources out there for those switching over from Matlab to python. The documentation for python packages is great. There are tons of examples and explanations about everything you could want. If you feel like the documentation isn't working out for you, simply googling something like "linspace in python" or "xlim in python" will usually get you what you need. Here are some resources to get you started.

**Packages**

There are two core packages --you can think of them like toolboxes --that reproduce most of the core Matlab package. They are [matplotlib][matplotlib], which is a plotting environment, and [numpy][numpy], which is a matrix multiplication library and much more. Some other interesting packages are [Scikit Learn][sklearn] for machine learning and [Pandas][pandas] for data manipulation and time series analysis.

Alright. Lets get into it!
