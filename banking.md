Notes from the khan academy playlist [Money and Banking][ka-playlist]. This came out in October 2008, so it offers a nice overview at a critical time.

## Banking 1 - Motivating Example

Let's say there are two groups of people:

1. Hardworking People - these people save the money (or gold) they earn from providing goods and services.
2. Entrepeuners - The people have ideas for project or investments.

The hardworking people are currently storing their money under their bed or burying it in their backyard. The entrepeuners want to use that money that isn't being utilized to start a new project -- for example to hire people to dig irrigation ditches to increase the amount of crop yield.

Let's imagine an entrepruener called Sal. Sal hits three problems when attempting to get funds to start his irrgiation project:

1. He doesn't know who has money. People don't want to broadcast how much money they have for fear of being robbed.
2. People don't know how to evaluate his project. For example, the dentist doesn't know much about irrigation or farming.
3. He would need to convince multiple people to fund his project since the savings from one person wouldn't be enough.

Sal even says that he will pay people back more than what they put in, but no one bites. He now sees a different problem he can solve--connecting people with savings with entrepueners. 

He decides to take $1M of his own money (equity) and build a big, solid, safe vault. He then goes out and convinces people in the community to store their money in the vault instead of putting it under their bed or burrying it in the backyard. This results in $10MM of deposits (a liability).

Chances are people won't come back all at once and request their money, so he keeps 10% ($1M) of it in reserve. He now has $9MM that he can lend out to other entrepueners. His setup looks like this:

In order to make money, Sal decides to charge 10% interest on the loans he makes and pays out 5% on the deposits he makes. Let's see what he makes after a year:

| Description         | Amount        |
| --------------------| ------------- |
| Loans               | +900K         |
| Deposits            | -500k         |
| Salaries & Security | -100k         |
| **TOTAL**           | +300k         |

<br/>
When the savings are matched up with good investments, everyone benefits. The people get better irrigation, they get interest on their savings, and the entrepruener gets to make money from the project.

As an aside, everyone thinks gold represents wealth while paper money does not. This is not true, gold is not useful for anything other than being pretty, limited, and hard to counterfit. Paper money is lighter and hard to counterfit. Gold is not really better than paper money.
